# **Brain storming** 


**Not implemented yet**:
* Add two guidances in front of docking points. And the spacecraft needs to eat both of them simulatenous. (Helping adjust the angle correctly.)






**Implemented**:
* Locking mechnisam: Lock the maximum velocity and orientation scale. **Performance:** Increase the perfect docking rates. However, this is aritificial involvement, not learned from RL.

* Guidances: Take the advantage of "Ray perception", leading the spacecraft to the correct direction. **Performance:** Good and easy.
